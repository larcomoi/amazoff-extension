<p>Most of the time when we get into amazon we get distracted by a lot of products, advertising and sales that lead us to buy a lot of useless objects. <br>

Have you ever tried to buy a school book on amazon? Do you remember how did your purchase go? How many other tabs have you visited? <br> And, above all, how many pair of psychedelic socks have you bought during your purchase? <br>

The purpose of our plugin is to remove all the elements that persuade the user to buy useless items. <br>
Using this plugin you are free to see only what you really want to see, avoiding external distractions. <br> <br>

<strong>Come on, turn the dictation off and focus on what you really need!</strong></p>
