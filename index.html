	<p>Most of the time when we get into amazon we get distracted by a lot of products, advertising and sales that lead us to buy a lot of useless objects.</p>

<p>Have you ever tried to buy a school book on amazon? Do you remember how did your purchase go? How many other tabs have you visited? And, above all, how many pair of psychedelic socks have you bought during your purchase?</p>

<p>The purpose of our plugin is to remove all the elements that persuade the user to buy useless items. 
Using this plugin you are free to see only what you really want to see, avoiding external distractions.</p>

<strong>Come on, turn the distractions off and focus on what you really need!</strong></p>
